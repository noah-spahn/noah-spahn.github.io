There are a few ways to go about local virtualization for various tasks on the
desktop. It's easy to get confused by following various wrtteups that are about
different technologies (when you are a total newb and don't know the difference
between the differences).

These notes are for Ubuntu Desktop 20.04. As usual, it's best to find an
reputable document, [something
official](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/virtualization-virt-tools)

If you need an ISO: it's also best to grab an official one from the correct
[web
site](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04.4/ubuntu-20.04.4-live-server-amd64.iso).
