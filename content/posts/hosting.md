When making a quick hosting solution with [nginx](https://gideonwolfe.com/posts/sysadmin/hugonginx/) and [hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#debian-and-ubuntu) please don't forget [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) because: why not?

`sudo apt install certbot`

`sudo apt install python3-certbot-nginx`
